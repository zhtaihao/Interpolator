ok basically have you ever had this problem where you need to connect several points in 2D space? 
but also you need a smooth transition between the starting point and the end point, as in the slope there has to be the same with the pre-existing slope.

having to solve this by hand has annoyed me to such an extend that here I am - writing damn code to perform this task which would be completed way faster by calculating it by hand. 
Is doing this time efficient? No. Will I still do it and eventually give up when I stumble upon a problem just a little too hard to solve? Heck yea!

you can do pull requests and stuff if you want
